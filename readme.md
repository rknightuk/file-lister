## Installation

Copy `index.php` and `inc` to the directory on your server where your files are. That's it.

## Configuration

Update the variables at the top of `index.php` to update the page title, url (used for redirecting to non-image files), allowed file type as well as changing the colour of the file icon.

## To do

- Different coloured icons for different filetypes
